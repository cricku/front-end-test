1) Brief instructions on how to run your code

Inside test-app folder run:
npm install
to install project dependencies.

After the dependencies are installed you just run:
npm run serve
to run the project locally.

I also submited my project here on Github pages:

https://cricku.github.io/front-end-test/

The notes.txt is located in test-app folder.

2) Any notes we should bear in mind (e.g. why you made an unusual choice)


3) A brief note on what you found hardest about the challenge
I can't say there were challanges

4) A brief note on how you could improve your code further
I will:
- add a Vue component framewrok/ CSS framework to speed development process
- try to create more atomic 

4) Any feedback to us on how to improve either the challenge itself or the recruitment process so far
As an observation when someone forks the original repo on they're 
account everyone can "spy" on their work.
I think that in one wireframe (Desktop Design Rules.png) the container width for the 
form doesn't have the corect size.
